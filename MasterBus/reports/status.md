## Current Progress

### Completed (Phase 1: Discovery and Planning)
* Project initialized
* MultiMind structure set up
* Project context document created
* Reference directories created for Condoit and ThreatMap
* README updated with project description
* Initial project directives defined for Phase 1: Discovery
* Created initial architecture documentation (docs/architecture.md)
* Created initial API specification (docs/api-spec.md)
* Created initial data model documentation (docs/data-models.md)
* Created project-specific roadmap
* Cloned and analyzed Condoit codebase
* Cloned and analyzed ThreatMap codebase
* Created Condoit analysis document (docs/condoit-analysis.md)
* Created ThreatMap analysis document (docs/threatmap-analysis.md)
* Updated API specification based on codebase analysis

### Completed (Phase 2: Core Development)
* Implemented all required data models with Pydantic
* Created API interfaces for VoltMetrics integration
* Developed core API endpoints following specification
* Implemented authentication using JWT tokens
* Created comprehensive test suite for models and API endpoints
* Set up FastAPI application structure
* Established basic project structure following best practices

### Completed (Phase 3: Integration Services)
* Implemented facility data transport services with caching support
* Created equipment data synchronization mechanisms
* Developed VoltMetrics interaction service with full API integration
* Implemented standardized error handling system across the API
* Implemented robust data validation for all inputs and outputs
* Developed webhook receiver for VoltMetrics calculation callbacks
* Created comprehensive integration tests for all new components
* Updated documentation and versioned the application to 0.3.0

## Key Findings

### Condoit Analysis
* Monorepo structure with apps (webapp-remix, mobileapp, eventbus) and shared packages
* Uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
* Rich data models for electrical equipment (panels, transformers, etc.)
* Contains the raw data needed for risk assessments (age, materials, etc.)
* The eventbus app could provide a way to subscribe to data changes

### ThreatMap Analysis
* Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind
* Expects facility data with risk scores, compliance status, and equipment details
* Visualizes risk using multiple charts and a geographic map
* Requires calculated fields (risk scores, compliance percentages, etc.)
* Currently uses mock data that defines the expected data structure

### Phase 3 Implementation Progress
* Created a hybrid cache invalidation strategy using Redis
* Implemented a robust error handling system with standardized responses
* Developed asynchronous communication with VoltMetrics calculation service
* Created data transport services for transforming Condoit data to ThreatMap format
* Implemented webhook endpoint for receiving callbacks from VoltMetrics
* Enabled background processing for batch calculation requests

## Blockers

* Unclear about specific completion protocols for Phase 3 beyond the roadmap tasks
* In the directives folder, only found completion protocols for Phase 1, but none for Phase 3
* Not certain if there's a specific completion report or documentation that needs to be filled out
* Unable to locate any specific completion command or process to execute at the end of Phase 3
* Need to confirm if the updates to roadmap.md, README.md, and status.md are sufficient for phase completion
* Need ThreatMap API credentials to implement full dashboard integration in Phase 4

## Next Steps

* Begin Phase 4: Dashboard Integration
* Create complete data pipeline from Condoit to ThreatMap
* Implement additional caching for performance optimization
* Add comprehensive logging and monitoring functionality
* Develop full integration tests for the entire pipeline
* Create API documentation for ThreatMap usage using Swagger/OpenAPI
