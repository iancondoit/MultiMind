# Project Completion: MasterBus - Phase2

Version: 0.3.0
Completed: 2025-05-23
Project: MasterBus
Phase: Core Development

## Completed Directives

* Implemented data models for Condoit information
* Created API interfaces for VoltMetrics integration
* Developed core API endpoints following specification
* Implemented authentication and security
* Created basic test suite for models and API

## Notes

All models have been implemented with proper validation and test coverage. The API endpoints match the specification in the documentation. Authentication is implemented as a placeholder using HTTPBearer security scheme and will need to be expanded with proper JWT validation in Phase 3.

The VoltMetrics integration API is in place, but currently uses mock implementations that will be replaced with actual service calls in Phase 3.

All tests are passing, and the code follows the TDD approach as required.

## Next Phase

Ready to begin work on Phase 3: Integration Services, which will focus on implementing the actual data transport and synchronization services, along with a robust VoltMetrics integration service.
