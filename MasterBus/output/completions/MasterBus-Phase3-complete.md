# Project Completion: MasterBus - Phase3

Version: 0.3.0
Completed: 2025-05-24
Project: MasterBus
Phase: Integration Services

## Completed Directives

* Implemented facility data transport services with caching support
* Created equipment data synchronization mechanisms
* Developed VoltMetrics interaction service with full API integration
* Implemented standardized error handling system across the API
* Implemented robust data validation for all inputs and outputs
* Developed webhook receiver for VoltMetrics calculation callbacks
* Created comprehensive integration tests for all new components
* Updated documentation and versioned the application to 0.3.0

## Notes

The Phase 3 implementation focused on building robust integration services between systems:

1. **Data Transport Service**: Created a service that handles facility and equipment data loading from Condoit, transformation, and delivery to ThreatMap. Implemented with proper caching support to optimize performance.

2. **VoltMetrics Integration**: Developed a full-featured client for the VoltMetrics API that handles risk calculation requests, polling for results, and retrieving compliance metrics.

3. **Error Handling**: Implemented a standardized error handling system with consistent error responses and appropriate HTTP status codes across all API endpoints.

4. **Caching Strategy**: Implemented the hybrid cache invalidation strategy as specified in Advisory 003, including time-based expiration, event-based invalidation, versioned cache keys, and soft invalidation.

5. **Webhooks**: Created a webhook receiver for VoltMetrics callbacks to handle asynchronous completion of calculation jobs.

All components were implemented following test-driven development practices with comprehensive test coverage.

## Next Phase

Ready to begin Phase 4: Dashboard Integration, focusing on creating the complete data pipeline from Condoit to ThreatMap, implementing additional caching for performance optimization, adding comprehensive logging and monitoring, and creating API documentation.
