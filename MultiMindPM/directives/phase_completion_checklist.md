## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for reviewing project phase completions. Use this checklist to ensure that completed phases meet quality standards and that blockers are addressed before the next phase begins.

## Initial Review

- [ ] **Completion Report Verification**
  - [ ] Confirm completion marker exists in MultiMindPM/completions
  - [ ] Verify completion date is reasonable and aligned with timeline
  - [ ] Check that version information is correctly specified

- [ ] **Status Report Review**
  - [ ] Confirm status report exists in MultiMindPM/reports
  - [ ] Verify that the report is up-to-date (within past week)
  - [ ] Check that the report follows the standard format

- [ ] **Directive Completion Check**
  - [ ] Compare completed items against required items in the directives
  - [ ] Verify that all required deliverables are mentioned in the status report
  - [ ] Identify any incomplete or partially complete items

## Quality Assessment

- [ ] **Documentation Assessment**
  - [ ] API documentation is complete and up-to-date
  - [ ] Architecture decisions are documented
  - [ ] Code is properly commented
  - [ ] README files are comprehensive and clear

- [ ] **Testing Verification**
  - [ ] Test coverage meets minimum requirements (80%+)
  - [ ] Unit tests are comprehensive
  - [ ] Integration tests are in place
  - [ ] Edge cases and failure scenarios are tested

- [ ] **Code Quality Check**
  - [ ] Code follows project coding standards
  - [ ] No critical linting issues are present
  - [ ] Code structure follows architectural guidelines
  - [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

## Blocker Analysis

- [ ] **Identified Blockers**
  - [ ] List all blockers mentioned in the status report
  - [ ] Prioritize blockers by impact on next phase
  - [ ] Identify dependencies between blockers

- [ ] **Technical Debt Assessment**
  - [ ] Identify technical debt accrued during the phase
  - [ ] Assess impact of technical debt on future phases
  - [ ] Create plan for addressing critical technical debt

- [ ] **Integration Readiness**
  - [ ] Verify integration points with other components
  - [ ] Check compatibility with dependent systems
  - [ ] Identify potential integration issues

## Response Planning

- [ ] **Advisory Creation**
  - [ ] Draft advisories for each significant blocker
  - [ ] Use appropriate advisory templates
  - [ ] Ensure advisories are specific and actionable
  - [ ] Link advisories to project roadmap items

- [ ] **Directive Updates**
  - [ ] Create directives for the next phase
  - [ ] Incorporate lessons learned from completed phase
  - [ ] Address technical debt in next phase tasks
  - [ ] Include clear completion reporting instructions

- [ ] **Timeline Assessment**
  - [ ] Evaluate impact of blockers on overall timeline
  - [ ] Adjust phase durations if necessary
  - [ ] Update dependencies between project timelines
  - [ ] Communicate timeline changes to affected teams

## Project-Specific Checks

### MasterBus

- [ ] **API Consistency**
  - [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
  - [ ] Authentication mechanisms are properly implemented
  - [ ] Error handling follows established standards
  - [ ] API versions are properly managed

- [ ] **Integration Points**
  - [ ] Condoit data access is properly implemented
  - [ ] ThreatMap data service endpoints are complete
  - [ ] VoltMetrics integration is designed and documented
  - [ ] Webhook handlers are implemented for asynchronous processes

### VoltMetrics

- [ ] **Algorithm Implementation**
  - [ ] Risk calculation algorithms are properly implemented
  - [ ] Algorithm performance meets requirements
  - [ ] Algorithm versioning is implemented
  - [ ] Calculation accuracy is validated against test cases

- [ ] **NFPA Compliance**
  - [ ] NFPA 70B compliance checks are implemented
  - [ ] NFPA 70E compliance checks are implemented
  - [ ] Compliance reporting is accurate and complete
  - [ ] Compliance recommendations are provided

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### Incomplete Documentation

**Signs**:
- Missing API endpoints in documentation
- Unclear architecture descriptions
- Outdated README files

**Resolution**:
1. Create advisory with specific documentation requirements
2. Provide documentation templates if needed
3. Request documentation updates before proceeding to next phase
4. Consider adding documentation-specific tasks to next phase directives

### Insufficient Testing

**Signs**:
- Low test coverage percentage
- Missing integration tests
- Significant untested components

**Resolution**:
1. Create advisory with specific testing requirements
2. Provide example tests if helpful
3. Require critical tests to be implemented before proceeding
4. Add comprehensive testing tasks to next phase directives

### Performance Concerns

**Signs**:
- Slow response times mentioned in status report
- Scaling issues identified
- Resource utilization problems

**Resolution**:
1. Create performance-focused advisory
2. Request profiling data to identify bottlenecks
3. Recommend specific optimization techniques
4. Prioritize performance tasks in next phase directives

### Integration Challenges

**Signs**:
- Incompatible API formats
- Authentication issues between components
- Data transformation problems

**Resolution**:
1. Create integration advisory with clear specifications
2. Facilitate communication between teams
3. Define clear integration contracts
4. Schedule integration-focused meetings

## Follow-up Process

After completing the phase review:

1. **Document Findings**
   - Summarize review results in standardized format
   - Note specific strengths and areas for improvement
   - Document technical debt for future reference

2. **Communicate with Teams**
   - Share review findings with project teams
   - Highlight specific areas requiring attention
   - Acknowledge achievements and successes

3. **Sync Updates**
   - Run `./multimind.py sync` to distribute advisories and updated directives
   - Confirm that teams have received the updates
   - Address any questions about the updates

4. **Schedule Check-in**
   - Set up follow-up meeting to discuss advisories
   - Establish timeline for implementing critical changes
   - Confirm understanding of next phase requirements
