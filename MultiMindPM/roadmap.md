# MultiMind Project Roadmap

Version: 0.2.0

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Set up project structure and configuration
- [x] Develop basic MultiMind orchestration tool
- [x] Create empty scaffolds for each subproject
- [x] Define data interchange formats

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] ProjectOne: Implement core component functionality
- [ ] ProjectTwo: Implement data processing capabilities
- [ ] ProjectThree: Create basic output templates

### Phase 3: Refinement
- [ ] ProjectOne: Add additional capabilities
- [ ] ProjectTwo: Add enhanced processing features
- [ ] ProjectThree: Implement multiple output formats

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Connect all three systems via file-based data passing
- [ ] Create end-to-end testing pipeline
- [ ] Implement workflow automation

## Data Flow Architecture

```
[User Input] → ProjectOne → [data.json] → ProjectTwo → [processed.json] → ProjectThree → [output.md]
```

## Milestones

1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
   - Basic data flow between all three systems
   - Simple processing capabilities
   - Plain text output

2. **Beta Release**
   - Improved data processing
   - Complete feature set
   - Multiple output formats

3. **Production Release**
   - Polished user experience
   - Performance optimizations
   - Extended capabilities

## Current Focus

The current focus is on Phase 2, developing core functionality of each component.

The top priorities are:
1. Implementing the ProjectOne core features
2. Defining clear interfaces between systems
3. Establishing processing logic in ProjectTwo
