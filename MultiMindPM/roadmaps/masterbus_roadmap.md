Updated: 2025-05-22

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Completed)
- [x] Analyze Condoit codebase and document data structures
- [x] Analyze ThreatMap requirements and JSON format
- [x] Create architecture document with technology stack decisions
- [x] Define data transformation requirements and mapping
- [x] Create API specification with endpoints and formats

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Implement data models for Condoit information
- [ ] Create API interfaces for VoltMetrics integration
- [ ] Develop core API endpoints following specification
- [ ] Implement authentication and security
- [ ] Create basic test suite for models and API

### Phase 3: Integration Services
- [ ] Implement facility data transport services
- [ ] Create equipment data synchronization mechanisms
- [ ] Develop VoltMetrics interaction service
- [ ] Implement data validation and error handling
- [ ] Expand test suite with integration tests

### Phase 4: Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Create complete data pipeline from Condoit to ThreatMap
- [ ] Implement caching for performance optimization
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring functionality
- [ ] Develop full integration tests
- [ ] Create API documentation for ThreatMap usage

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Prepare deployment documentation
- [ ] Create environment configuration templates
- [ ] Document scaling considerations
- [ ] Define maintenance procedures
- [ ] Prepare for multi-system integration with MultiMind

## Milestones

1. **Foundation (Completed)**
   - Complete system architecture design
   - Confirm data mapping between systems
   - Agree on technology stack and standards

2. **Core API (Current)**
   - Basic API endpoints implemented
   - Data models created
   - Authentication working

3. **Integration Services**
   - VoltMetrics API integration complete
   - Data synchronization working
   - Validation and error handling implemented

4. **Dashboard Ready**
   - End-to-end data flow working
   - Performance optimized
   - API fully documented

5. **Deployment Ready**
   - All documentation complete
   - Deployment procedures tested
   - System ready for production

## Current Focus

The current focus is on beginning Phase 2, specifically implementing the data models and core API structure defined in the Phase 1 documentation.

The top priorities are:
1. Implementing data models based on the data-models.md specification
2. Setting up the API framework with initial endpoints
3. Creating the testing framework for TDD approach
4. Designing the VoltMetrics integration service
