# MasterBus Project Roadmap

Version: 0.1.0
Created: 2025-05-20

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning
- [ ] Analyze Condoit codebase and document data structures
- [ ] Analyze ThreatMap requirements and JSON format
- [ ] Create architecture document with technology stack decisions
- [ ] Define data transformation requirements and mapping
- [ ] Create API specification with endpoints and formats

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Implement data models for Condoit information
- [ ] Create transformation services for risk assessment
- [ ] Develop core API endpoints following specification
- [ ] Implement authentication and security
- [ ] Create basic test suite for models and API

### Phase 3: Data Processing Implementation
- [ ] Implement facility data aggregation services
- [ ] Create risk calculation algorithms
- [ ] Develop compliance percentage calculations
- [ ] Implement data validation and error handling
- [ ] Expand test suite with data processing tests

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Create sample data pipeline from Condoit to ThreatMap
- [ ] Implement caching for performance optimization
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring functionality
- [ ] Develop full integration tests
- [ ] Create API documentation for ThreatMap usage

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Prepare deployment documentation
- [ ] Create environment configuration templates
- [ ] Document scaling considerations
- [ ] Define maintenance procedures
- [ ] Prepare for multi-system integration with MultiMind

   - Agree on technology stack and standards

2. **Core API**
   - Basic API endpoints implemented
   - Data models created
   - Authentication working

3. **Data Processing**
   - Risk assessment algorithms working
   - Compliance calculations implemented
   - Data validation complete

4. **Integration Ready**
   - End-to-end data flow working
   - Performance optimized
   - API fully documented

5. **Deployment Ready**
   - All documentation complete
   - Deployment procedures tested
   - System ready for production

## Current Focus

The current focus is on completing Phase 1, specifically understanding both codebases, defining the architecture, and creating the API specification.

The top priorities are:
1. Importing and analyzing both codebases
2. Defining the technology stack for MasterBus
3. Creating detailed data mappings between systems
