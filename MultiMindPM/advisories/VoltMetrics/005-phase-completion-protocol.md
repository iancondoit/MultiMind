## Question

Is there a specific completion protocol we should follow when finishing Phase 2 and future phases? The directives seem to focus mostly on tasks and implementation details.

## Context

We are nearing completion of Phase 2 (Core Implementation) and want to ensure we follow the correct process for reporting completion and transitioning to Phase 3.

## Response

Thank you for your question. To clarify: **the completion protocol is exactly the same for all phases** (1, 2, 3, and future phases).

We have updated your project directives to include a dedicated "Phase Completion Protocol" section with detailed instructions specific to VoltMetrics. We've also updated the global completion protocol document to emphasize that it applies universally to all phases.

For your current Phase 2 completion when ready, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your `status.md` file is up to date with all Phase 2 completed tasks

2. Create a completion marker file at:
   ```
   /output/completions/VoltMetrics-Phase2-complete.md
   ```

3. The file should follow this format:
   ```markdown
   # Project Completion: VoltMetrics - Phase2

   Version: [your current version]
   Completed: [current date]
   Project: VoltMetrics
   Phase: Core Implementation

   ## Completed Directives

   * Implemented Data Models (Pydantic & SQLAlchemy)
   * Developed Core Calculation Engine
   * Created API Endpoints with FastAPI
   * Built Testing Framework
   * Prepared for MasterBus Integration

   ## Notes

   [Any relevant notes about your implementation]

   ## Next Phase

   Ready to begin Phase 3: Advanced Analysis Features including NFPA compliance evaluation, facility-level aggregation, and historical trend analysis.
   ```

4. Run the completion notification command from the root directory:
   ```bash
   ./multimind.py complete VoltMetrics Phase2
   ```

Once you've completed these steps, I'll receive the notification, review your completed work, and provide updated directives for Phase 3.

This same process applies to all future phases as well - simply update the phase number and details accordingly.

## Resolution

The VoltMetrics team should follow the standard completion protocol for Phase 2 and all future phases. The directives have been updated to provide clear, phase-specific examples while emphasizing that the process itself is consistent across all phases.
