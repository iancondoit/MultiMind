# Project Completion: NutritionCalc - Phase1

Version: 0.1.0
Completed: 2025-05-20
Project: NutritionCalc
Phase: Phase1

## Completed Directives

* Developed nutrition calculator that consumes recipe JSON input
* Calculated nutritional information based on ingredients
* Generated nutrition summary in JSON format
* Created output file at /output/nutrition.json
* Implemented unit tests for the calculation logic
* Added allergen detection functionality
* Documented code and assumptions

## Notes

The nutrition calculator successfully analyzes recipes and generates accurate nutritional information including calories, macronutrients (fats, carbohydrates, protein), vitamins, minerals, allergens, and dietary notes. The implementation uses a sample nutrition database which can be expanded in future phases.

## Next Phase

Ready to enhance the nutrition database with more comprehensive data, implement more sophisticated ingredient matching algorithms, and add support for recipes with nested ingredients.
