# Project Completion: IngredientEngine - Phase1

Version: 0.1.0
Completed: 2025-05-20
Project: IngredientEngine
Phase: Phase1

## Completed Directives

* Implemented prompt-to-recipe converter
* Created JSON schema for recipe output
* Added basic validation for ingredient format
* Generated structured recipe from text input
* Built core components following TDD principles
* Implemented ingredient parsing and amount standardization
* Added cuisine detection based on prompt keywords
* Created dietary restriction identification

## Notes

The implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:
- `models/recipe.py` contains the Recipe and Ingredient data models
- `utils/prompt_parser.py` handles parsing user prompts into structured data
- `utils/json_validator.py` ensures JSON output meets the required schema
- `main.py` provides a CLI interface for the entire system

All tests are passing, and the system can generate recipes based on simple prompts.

## Next Phase

Ready to begin work on enhanced parsing features for complex recipes.
