## Request

ProjectOne should enhance the data JSON schema to include a "metadata.processingFlags" object that provides configuration options for downstream processing.

## Context

ProjectTwo needs to apply different processing strategies based on data characteristics, but the current schema doesn't provide a way to specify these preferences. Adding processing flags in the source data would enable more flexible processing pipelines.

## Implementation Details

1. Update the data JSON schema to include:
   ```json
   {
     "metadata": {
       "processingFlags": {
         "enableAdvancedAnalysis": true,
         "processingMode": "standard|detailed|minimal",
         "includeRawData": false,
         "priority": 1
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Modify the data generation logic to include these flags
3. Ensure default values are provided when not specified
4. Update validation to verify the flags are properly formatted
