## PM Summary

The MasterBus project has successfully completed the initial setup and Discovery phase has begun. We have cloned and analyzed both the Condoit and ThreatMap codebases to understand their structure, data models, and integration requirements.

### Key Findings

1. **Condoit Codebase**:
   - Monorepo structure with multiple apps and shared packages
   - Rich data models for electrical equipment managed through Prisma ORM
   - Contains comprehensive raw data about electrical infrastructure
   - Event bus component might be leveraged for real-time data synchronization

2. **ThreatMap Requirements**:
   - Needs processed risk assessment data in specific JSON formats
   - Visualizes facility-level risk scores and equipment-level risk factors
   - Requires calculated fields for compliance status and risk metrics
   - Uses historical data for trend visualization

3. **Data Transformation Needs**:
   - Equipment risk score calculation based on multiple factors
   - Facility-level aggregation of risk metrics
   - Compliance evaluation for NFPA standards
   - Historical trend data generation

### Next Steps

1. Research NFPA standards to establish compliance calculation methods
2. Design risk assessment algorithms with domain expertise
3. Create a database schema for the MasterBus service
4. Design authentication and security mechanisms
5. Implement core data models and transformation services

### Blockers

* Need domain expertise to define risk calculation formulas
* Require technology stack decisions for the MasterBus service
* Need authentication/security requirements clarification

### Timeline Update

We are on track with the Phase 1 timeline. We anticipate completion of the Discovery phase within the original timeframe, pending clarification on the blocker items.
