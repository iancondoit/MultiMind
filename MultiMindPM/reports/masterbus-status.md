## Current Progress

* Project initialized
* MultiMind structure set up
* Project context document created
* Reference directories created for Condoit and ThreatMap
* README updated with project description
* Initial project directives defined for Phase 1: Discovery
* Created initial architecture documentation (docs/architecture.md)
* Created initial API specification (docs/api-spec.md)
* Created initial data model documentation (docs/data-models.md)
* Created project-specific roadmap
* Cloned and analyzed Condoit codebase
* Cloned and analyzed ThreatMap codebase
* Created Condoit analysis document (docs/condoit-analysis.md)
* Created ThreatMap analysis document (docs/threatmap-analysis.md)
* Updated API specification based on codebase analysis

## Key Findings

### Condoit Analysis
* Monorepo structure with apps (webapp-remix, mobileapp, eventbus) and shared packages
* Uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
* Rich data models for electrical equipment (panels, transformers, etc.)
* Contains the raw data needed for risk assessments (age, materials, etc.)
* The eventbus app could provide a way to subscribe to data changes

### ThreatMap Analysis
* Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind
* Expects facility data with risk scores, compliance status, and equipment details
* Visualizes risk using multiple charts and a geographic map
* Requires calculated fields (risk scores, compliance percentages, etc.)
* Currently uses mock data that defines the expected data structure

### Data Transformation Requirements
* Calculate equipment risk scores based on age, materials, and inspection status
* Aggregate metrics at facility level (equipment counts, risk distribution)
* Evaluate NFPA 70B and 70E compliance status
* Generate historical trends for risk metrics

## Blockers

* Need detailed information about electrical risk assessment factors
* Need confirmation on technology stack preferences for MasterBus
* Need to determine authentication mechanism for API
* Need more information on NFPA 70B/70E standards and their compliance requirements

## Next Steps

* Research NFPA 70B and 70E standards for compliance metrics
* Develop risk calculation algorithms with domain experts
* Create MasterBus database schema for caching and historical data
* Design authentication system for the API
* Begin implementing core data models and transformation services
