# Condoit Integration Project Summary

Version: 0.1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-20

## Overview

This report summarizes the current status of the Condoit-MasterBus-ThreatMap integration project. The project is organized into two main components:

1. **MasterBus** - API layer for data transformation and delivery
2. **VoltMetrics** - Analysis engine for risk assessment calculations

## Architecture Evolution

Based on our initial analysis, we have refined the architecture into a more modular design:

```
┌───────────┐        ┌───────────┐        ┌───────────┐        ┌───────────┐
│           │        │           │        │           │        │           │
│  Condoit  │───────►│ MasterBus │───────►│VoltMetrics│───────►│ ThreatMap │
│           │        │           │        │           │        │           │
└───────────┘        └───────────┘        └───────────┘        └───────────┘
   Data Source         API Layer          Analysis Engine        Dashboard
```

This separation of concerns allows:
- MasterBus to focus on data transformation and API endpoints
- VoltMetrics to handle computationally intensive risk calculations
- Clear interfaces between components for maintenance and scaling

## Current Status by Component

### MasterBus (API Layer)

**Status:** Initial design completed

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Analyzed Condoit and ThreatMap codebases
- Designed API specification with comprehensive endpoints
- Documented data models and transformation requirements
- Created architecture documentation

**Blockers:**
- Need detailed information about electrical risk assessment factors
- Need confirmation on technology stack preferences
- Need to determine authentication mechanism for API

**Next Steps:**
- Research NFPA standards for compliance metrics
- Design authentication system for the API
- Create MasterBus database schema for caching and historical data

### VoltMetrics (Analysis Engine)

**Status:** Architecture and algorithm design completed

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Defined risk calculation algorithms and formulas
- Created API specification for integration with MasterBus
- Designed architecture with emphasis on scalability and performance
- Documented algorithm versioning strategy

**Blockers:**
- Need consultation with electrical engineering experts
- Require dataset for algorithm testing and validation
- Need clarification on NFPA standards interpretation

**Next Steps:**
- Research Python libraries for statistical analysis
- Develop proof-of-concept for core algorithm implementation
- Design database schema for calculation results

## Integration Strategy

The two components will integrate through well-defined APIs:

1. MasterBus sends raw data to VoltMetrics for processing
2. VoltMetrics performs calculations and stores results
3. MasterBus retrieves processed results from VoltMetrics
4. ThreatMap consumes the enriched data via MasterBus API

This approach allows each component to be developed, tested, and scaled independently.

## Risk Factors

1. **Domain Expertise Gap** - Risk calculation formulas need validation by electrical engineering experts
2. **Data Volume Uncertainty** - Scale requirements need clarification for proper architecture design
3. **Performance Requirements** - Need to establish acceptable response times for API endpoints
4. **Standards Interpretation** - NFPA 70B and 70E standards need detailed analysis

## Timeline Projection

| Phase | Timeline | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Initial Setup | Completed | ✅ |
| Discovery & Analysis | Completed | ✅ |
| Architecture Design | Completed | ✅ |
| Core Implementation | 4-6 weeks | 🔜 |
| Integration Testing | 2-3 weeks | 📅 |
| Performance Optimization | 2 weeks | 📅 |
| Deployment & Handover | 1 week | 📅 |

## Overall Assessment

The project has successfully completed the initial discovery and architecture design phases. The decision to separate the analysis engine (VoltMetrics) from the API layer (MasterBus) will provide better scalability and maintainability.

Both components have well-defined interfaces and responsibilities, which will facilitate parallel development. The critical blockers are primarily related to domain expertise in electrical risk assessment and NFPA standards interpretation rather than technical challenges.

## Recommendations

1. Schedule consultation with electrical engineering experts to validate risk calculation approaches
2. Acquire sample datasets from Condoit for algorithm testing
3. Research NFPA 70B and 70E standards in detail
4. Begin implementing core components while domain questions are resolved
5. Consider containerization strategy for deployment flexibility
