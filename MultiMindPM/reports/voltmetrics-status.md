## Current Progress

* Completed Phase 1: Architecture and Algorithm Design
* Completed Phase 2: Core Implementation
* Completed Phase 3: Advanced Analysis Features
* Ready to begin Phase 4: Performance Optimization

## Phase 3 Accomplishments

* Implemented NFPA 70B compliance evaluation for maintenance standards
* Developed NFPA 70E compliance evaluation for electrical safety
* Created facility-level aggregation algorithms with weighted risk assessment
* Implemented time-series database models for historical trend analysis
* Developed forecasting algorithms for risk prediction and maintenance planning
* Extended API endpoints for compliance, aggregation, and forecasting

## Key Architecture Components

* Core risk calculation engine with comprehensive risk factor analysis
* Compliance evaluation modules for NFPA 70B and 70E standards
* Facility aggregator for equipment-to-facility risk analysis
* TimescaleDB-compatible models for historical data storage
* Advanced forecasting algorithms with non-linear aging adjustments
* FastAPI endpoints for all features with standardized response formats

## API Integration Status

* Basic integration with MasterBus established
* Authentication mechanism implemented (JWT-based)
* Webhook notification framework in place
* Response formats aligned with MasterBus requirements
* Comprehensive API documentation completed

## Blockers

* Need production-scale test data for performance optimization
* Require performance testing environment that matches production
* Need to coordinate with MasterBus team on async calculation notification formats

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

* Implement Redis caching layer for calculation results
* Develop background processing for intensive calculations
* Create notification system for asynchronous calculation completion
* Optimize algorithms for scale and performance
* Implement batch processing for large datasets
