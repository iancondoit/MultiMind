# VoltMetrics Status Report

Version: 0.1.0

## Last Update

2025-05-20

## Current Progress

* Project initialized
* VoltMetrics structure set up
* Created project README and architecture overview
* Defined risk calculation algorithms and formulas
* Created API specification for integration with MasterBus
* Documented core components and data flow

## Key Architecture Decisions

* Designed as standalone analysis engine separated from the API layer
* Python-based calculation engine with FastAPI interfaces
* Asynchronous processing architecture for long-running calculations
* Algorithm versioning to track changes in risk calculations over time
* Time-series database for storing historical risk data
* Redis caching for performance optimization

## Risk Algorithm Development

* Defined equipment risk score calculation formulas
* Created facility-level risk aggregation methods
* Established NFPA 70B and 70E compliance calculation approaches
* Defined algorithm versioning strategy
* Outlined historical trend analysis approach

## API Integration

* Designed data ingestion endpoints for equipment and facility data
* Created job management API for batch processing
* Specified results API for retrieving calculated metrics
* Developed webhook notification system for asynchronous processing

## Blockers

* Need consultation with electrical engineering experts to validate risk formulas
* Require dataset for algorithm testing and validation
* Need clarification on NFPA standards interpretation
* Technology stack decisions need finalization

## Next Steps

* Research Python libraries for statistical analysis and time-series processing
* Develop proof-of-concept for core algorithm implementation
* Define algorithm testing methodology
* Design database schema for calculation results
* Create mock dataset for initial testing
