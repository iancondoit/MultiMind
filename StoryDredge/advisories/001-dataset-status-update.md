# Advisory: Dataset Status and Pipeline Readiness

Version: 1.0.0
Status: ACTIVE
Project: StoryDredge
Created: 2025-01-31
Last Updated: 2025-01-31

## Context

StoryMap has completed their infrastructure repair and is now operational. However, they currently only have access to 222 articles instead of the expected 1.6M articles due to remote server access issues.

## Current Situation

### StoryMap Infrastructure ✅
- **API Status**: Fully operational FastAPI implementation
- **Database**: Optimized and ready for millions of articles
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times confirmed
- **Integration**: Ready for StoryMine connection

### Dataset Status ⚠️
- **Current Available**: 222 Atlanta Constitution articles
- **Expected**: 1.6M articles previously processed
- **Issue**: Remote server with larger dataset no longer accessible
- **Impact**: Infrastructure is ready, but limited test data available

## Questions for StoryDredge Team

### 1. Dataset Availability
- Do you have access to the original 1.6M articles that were previously processed?
- Are these articles available in your output directory structure?
- Can you provide the larger dataset to StoryMap for immediate ingestion?

### 2. Processing Pipeline Status
- Is your current processing pipeline operational for new articles?
- Can you process additional newspaper collections from archive.org?
- What is your current processing capacity (articles per day/week)?

### 3. Integration Readiness
- Are you ready to establish the automated pipeline to StoryMap?
- Do you need any technical specifications from StoryMap's new FastAPI system?
- Can you provide sample output for StoryMap to test their ingestion pipeline?

## Immediate Opportunities

### 1. Restore Full Dataset
If you have access to the 1.6M articles:
- Provide them to StoryMap for immediate ingestion
- This would enable full-scale testing of the StoryMine integration
- Jordi could access the complete historical dataset

### 2. Expand Processing
- Identify additional newspaper collections on archive.org
- Begin processing new collections to expand beyond 1.6M articles
- Establish continuous processing pipeline for ongoing growth

### 3. Pipeline Integration
- Work with StoryMap to establish automated data transfer
- Test the new FastAPI ingestion endpoints
- Optimize for continuous article processing

## Technical Coordination

### StoryMap Integration Points
- **API Endpoints**: StoryMap ready to receive article data
- **Data Format**: JSON format specifications available
- **Performance**: Infrastructure tested and optimized
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and error handling operational

### Expected Data Flow
```
StoryDredge JSON Output → StoryMap Ingestion → PostgreSQL → StoryMine API → Jordi
```

## Success Metrics

Your contribution is successful when:
- [ ] Larger dataset (1.6M+ articles) available to StoryMap
- [ ] Automated pipeline established for continuous processing
- [ ] New articles being processed and ingested regularly
- [ ] StoryMine has access to substantial historical content for Jordi

## Timeline

- **Immediate**: Assess availability of 1.6M article dataset
- **Week 1**: Provide larger dataset to StoryMap if available
- **Week 2**: Establish automated pipeline for continuous processing
- **Ongoing**: Process additional collections from archive.org

## Support

- **Technical Questions**: Coordinate with StoryMap team on data format requirements
- **Infrastructure Issues**: Escalate to PM for resource allocation
- **Archive.org Access**: Document any access or processing limitations

**Your role as the data acquisition engine is critical to the ecosystem's success. The infrastructure is ready - we need the data to unlock the full potential of millions of historical articles accessible through Jordi.**
