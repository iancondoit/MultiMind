# MultiMind Improvement Log

Version: 0.1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-20

## Overview

This document tracks observations, ideas, and suggested improvements for the MultiMind project orchestration system as we use it for the Condoit-MasterBus-ThreatMap integration project.

## Current Observations

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Created output directories manually - could be automated during first run

2. **Reference Code Handling**:
   - There's no standard structure for reference code repositories
   - Multi-repo projects need specific handling for "reference-only" vs. "active development" code

3. **Documentation Creation**:
   - API specification markup is useful but not enforced by the system
   - Would be helpful to have standardized templates for common documentation types

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - Had to manually read through code to understand structures
   - Could benefit from automated code structure extraction tools

5. **Branching Strategy**:
   - The system doesn't specify or manage git branch handling
   - Would be useful to have standard branch naming conventions

## Suggested Improvements

### Critical

*None yet*

### High Priority

1. **Project Reference Structure**:
   - Add support for reference-only repositories
   - Create standardized structure for importing and analyzing external codebases
   - Add documentation templates for code analysis reports

### Medium Priority

1. **Setup Automation**:
   - Add automatic creation of required directories during initialization
   - Support for project-specific git configurations

2. **Code Analysis Tools**:
   - Add tools to extract and summarize data models from codebases
   - Support for generating relationship diagrams between components

### Low Priority

1. **Branch Management**:
   - Add branch naming convention enforcement
   - Support for feature branch tracking

## Implementation Notes

This section will contain notes on any improvements we implement during the project.

## Rationale

This log helps us track ideas for improving MultiMind while focusing on our primary development task. Once the MasterBus project is complete, we can review this log to enhance the orchestration system based on real-world usage.
