# Project Completion: VoltMetrics - Phase3

Version: 0.2.0
Completed: 2025-05-25
Project: VoltMetrics
Phase: Advanced Analysis Features

## Completed Directives

* Implemented NFPA 70B compliance evaluation for maintenance standards
* Developed NFPA 70E compliance evaluation for electrical safety
* Created facility-level aggregation algorithms with weighted risk assessment
* Implemented time-series database models for historical trend analysis
* Developed forecasting algorithms for risk prediction and maintenance planning
* Extended API endpoints for compliance, aggregation, and forecasting

## Notes

The implementation follows the directive guidelines and successfully integrates with the existing core calculation engine. Key achievements include:

1. **Compliance Evaluation**: Both equipment-level and facility-level compliance evaluations are now available, providing detailed insights into NFPA 70B and 70E compliance status.

2. **Aggregation**: The facility aggregator provides weighted risk assessments that prioritize critical equipment and identifies top risk factors across facilities.

3. **Time-Series Database**: The implementation includes models designed for TimescaleDB compatibility with appropriate indexing for efficient time-based queries.

4. **Forecasting**: Advanced algorithms for risk prediction include non-linear aging effects and can blend multiple data sources for more accurate facility-level forecasts.

All implementations include comprehensive test coverage and adhere to the project's coding standards.

## Next Phase

Ready to begin Phase 4: Performance Optimization, focusing on caching, background processing, notification systems, and algorithm optimization for handling large datasets.
