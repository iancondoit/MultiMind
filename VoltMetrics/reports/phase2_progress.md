# VoltMetrics Phase 2 Progress Report

Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2025-05-25
Status: IN PROGRESS

## Summary

Phase 2 implementation of the VoltMetrics risk assessment engine has begun. This phase focuses on core calculation engine development and data models. Initial implementations of the data models and risk calculation algorithms have been completed, along with a basic API interface for data ingestion.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented data models for equipment information
- [x] Implemented data models for facility information
- [x] Created core risk calculation engine with multi-factor assessment
- [x] Developed initial API endpoints for data ingestion
- [x] Implemented test suite with comprehensive unit tests

## Current Work

- [ ] Implementing batch processing for large datasets
- [ ] Enhancing equipment risk calculations with additional factors
- [ ] Creating database integration for persistent storage
- [ ] Developing visualization endpoints for risk data

## Technical Decisions

1. **Risk Algorithm Design**:
   - Implemented non-linear scaling for age-related risk
   - Created weighted scoring system based on industry standards
   - Established risk thresholds matching NFPA guidelines

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Created flexible data models with extension points
   - Implemented serialization for API interactions
   - Added comprehensive validation for input data

3. **API Architecture**:
   - Built RESTful API with FastAPI
   - Implemented in-memory storage for prototype phase
   - Added detailed error handling and input validation

## Challenges

- **Risk Factor Weighting**: Determining appropriate weights for risk factors required extensive research into electrical standards and consultation with the advisory document
- **Algorithm Versioning**: Establishing a versioning approach for risk calculations to ensure reproducibility of results

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 tasks
2. Integrate database for persistent storage
3. Enhance testing with more real-world electrical configurations
4. Prepare for Phase 3 implementation of compliance evaluation

## Resources Required

- Access to NFPA 70B and 70E standards documentation for compliance algorithm development
- Additional test data for more diverse equipment configurations
