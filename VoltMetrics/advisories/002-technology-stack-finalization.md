# Advisory: Technology Stack Finalization for Implementation

Version: 0.1.0
Status: ANSWERED
Project: VoltMetrics
Created: 2025-05-22
Last Updated: 2025-05-22

## Question

What technology stack should we use for the VoltMetrics implementation phase?

## Context

The VoltMetrics status report identified "Technology stack decisions need finalization" as a blocker. As we transition from architecture and design to implementation, we need clear guidance on the technology stack to use.

## Response

### Core Technology Stack

Based on the architecture design and performance requirements, here is the finalized technology stack for VoltMetrics:

1. **Programming Language**
   - Python 3.10+ (primary language)
   - Use type hints throughout the codebase
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

2. **API Framework**
   - FastAPI
     - High performance, built on Starlette and Pydantic
     - Automatic OpenAPI documentation
     - Native async support for handling concurrent calculations
     - Excellent type validation

3. **Database Architecture**
   - **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
     - Store calculation results
     - Maintain historical data
     - Store algorithm versions and metadata
   - **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0
     - Use the new 2.0-style queries
     - Define models with declarative base
   - **Migrations**: Alembic
     - Track all schema changes
     - Enable rollback capability

4. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis
     - Cache calculation results
     - Store temporary job status
     - Implement pub/sub for calculation notifications

5. **Time-Series Storage**
   - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension)
     - Store historical risk trends
     - Enable efficient time-bound queries
     - Support for downsampling

6. **Testing Framework**
   - pytest
     - Use fixtures for test data
     - Implement parameterized testing for calculation variants
   - pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - Hypothesis for property-based testing of mathematical algorithms

7. **Containerization**
   - Docker
     - Individual containers for API, workers, and database
     - Docker Compose for local development
   - Kubernetes for production deployment (future)

8. **CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions
     - Automated testing
     - Linting and static type checking
     - Container builds

### Auxiliary Libraries

1. **Calculation and Data Science**
   - NumPy for mathematical operations
   - pandas for data manipulation and analysis
   - SciPy for more advanced statistical functions

2. **Schema Validation**
   - Pydantic for data validation and settings management
   - JSON Schema for API documentation

3. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

4. **Messaging**
   - Redis Pub/Sub for simple messaging
   - Consider RabbitMQ for more complex work queue scenarios in the future

### Development Environment

1. Set up a consistent development environment using:
   - python-dotenv for environment variables
   - pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - black and isort for code formatting
   - mypy for static type checking
   - flake8 for linting

2. Development workflow:
   - Test-driven development for all core algorithms
   - Feature branches with PR reviews
   - CI validation before merging

### Directory Structure

├── docker/                # Docker configuration
└── docs/                  # Documentation
```

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up the project skeleton with this structure
2. Create a development Docker Compose configuration
3. Implement base models using Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
4. Establish CI pipeline with basic tests

This technology stack aligns with the architecture design and will provide the performance, reliability, and maintainability needed for the VoltMetrics engine.
